Concept:
The two axis of the project are ‘Sustainability’ and ‘Community’. The initial idea to contain those two main aspects was a modular form of apartment builds which would be flexible and expandable. The thirty apartment proposal is only an initial stage of the project, in which in time and as the community expands or creates bonds, the proposal evolves with more connections between the apartments and shared spaces. 
A one person apartment will be easily get evolved to a two person apartment or to a family apartment and so on. Also an apartment can also connect with a shared space (green roof, garden or even glass house garden) with another apartment creating bonds and shared activities thus a stronger community. The modular form of the buildings allows this evolution with a variety of choice designs.
The ‘community’ aspect is enforced through the modularity of the design, to a number of possibilities in that community’s expansion/evolution.
Sustainability is expressed through both the choice of materials and the everyday community activities. Materiality such as local timber and recycled steel is used for the main units. Recycled aggregate paving, natural gravels and stones selected from local sources. Wild green roofs, living walls and use of native planting are supporting the wildlife in the region, increasing the biodiversity. Rain water harvesting, permeable and geothermal paving allow water to be stored in a sub base and generate sufficient energy to allow transference of heat in and out of a building. Heat pumps using the earth's ground temperature and extract energy to cool the buildings and support the heat in the winter.
Green spaces such as green roofs and green glass houses, adding to the community’s sustainability in the form of vegetable and fruit production for every residence. Possibly leading to trading interactions, sharing and moreover expansion to more shared spaces, thus more building connection/evolution.
