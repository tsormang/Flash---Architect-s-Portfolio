Concept:
The design initiates from the pure form of the cube and by applying two basic ideas. Firstly, the heart of the cube is the heart of the family. The place where the grandparents, the parents and the children will spend most of the time together. This place has to be visible to the neighbours so as  to work as an inspiration for them. By creating this special place we also create a ‘void’ mass that will subtract from the main house cube mass. This will allow that space to become ’semi-private’ with visual access but not physical.
The next idea has to do with the shape of the voids and how they allow light and vision to the ‘heart’ of the house. By creating angles to the openings vision from outside its easier thus the idea of the ‘united family’ is greatly expanding outside the house. 
Finally the whole house is one family that is composed by two different elements, the family with the children and the grandparents. Those two elements are separated inside the house with the ;heart’ of the house to be the meeting point. Also the materiality is different with the grandparents to have a more timber bases construction, in comparison to the plain white one of the parents and children.
