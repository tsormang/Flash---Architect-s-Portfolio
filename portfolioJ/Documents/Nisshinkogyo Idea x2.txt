Puppet performer’s house
Artist: The fictional artist is a puppet performer and crafter. He and his wife performed with puppets for children, for many years in a big city centre. A tragedy occurred and he lost his wife in an accident, which also left him disabled. He now uses a wheelchair and his art is more of a puppet crafting than performance. His daughter also studied performance. They came really close after the accident and now they live in a complete symbiosis of life and arts. He creates, whereas she performs, so as to keep both their arts alive. They need to perform and live together, in a space that enables it.
Concept: The concept model (image 1) represents the puppet performance. The two concrete walls are the husband and wife, the puppet creator and performer. Since the wife’s passing, the daughter becomes the second artist, the performer. So a new wall is added to create a new space for their co-existence in arts and life (image 4). This new wall which represents the daughter separates the public space from the private and also connects the performing with the puppet creation.
The house is in the centre of a city in a corner site. Since the first artist is disabled all inclusive design aspects are taken into consideration. The house is design so as to amplify the relationship between the father and the daughter, the puppet crafter and the puppet performer, their need to live and work together as one.
