The Idea:
The idea initiates from Onomichi complex of small streets, alleys and paths. One can walk and enjoy quite green spaces, steep slopes, narrow paths in between big rocks, meeting path points and much more. This variety creates a unique experience for walking. Something that most habitants of a big city rarely enjoy in their everyday routine.
The Concept:
Focusing in Hiroshima city centre the idea develops in a complex path network. Five small parks in the heart of Hiroshima are considered the starting points of some complex paths, which connect each other. Those five green spaces initiate a network, which follows a complex pattern through the urban fabric, with new connections only to be the secondary objective. The basis for this idea is mainly to provide a unique experience to the Hiroshima city’s inhabitants. An experience one can get to the complex paths of Onomichi, with all the characteristics it provides.
By focusing on the Hiroshima Park, we study in detail the possible routes through the existing buildings and how the variety of ‘Onomichi’ experiences are placed into the Hiroshima’s new path.
