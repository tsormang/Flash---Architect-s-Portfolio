Inspiration and creation in a natural slope
Artists: The couple of artists are a famous fictional writer and his wife, a garden planner/artist. Their different forms of art, provide two contrasting approaches in the house design which collide into a symbiosis of arts, like the couple’s life.
Concept: The writers approach derives from Onomichi temple district which has a natural path in the forest slope, which writers use to walk for inspiration. The Garden artist’s concept is this of Japanese ‘Dandan’ rice levelled fields. Those two ideas bring together, form a house in a slope which serves both artist’s living and art purposes. 
The rice level fields are now the house rooms and gardens. Every section of the house has a ‘natural’ form in a different level with green roof to be used as gardens. The whole house is formed around the ‘Onomichi’ existing path in the slope. This path represents the writer’s path. A new path is created along the house forms, which used as a shortcut for the existing one and also connects all the gardens together. That new path represents the garden artist’s art.
The two paths create spaces in between which can be separated in private for writer or his wife and public, for both of them and potential guests. This difference in the houses space is also expressed in materiality. The private writer’s space is made of a more ‘natural’ stone masonry, whereas the garden artist’s private spaces (two interior garden rooms) are using corten (rusted) steel. Their shared spaces share materials as well, with the use of gabions (stones in steel cages).
